**Campus-Dijkstra-Way** is a web application that helps you find the shortest path between locations within Jain University using **Dijkstra's Algorithm**. This tool is designed to make campus navigation easier, by providing an efficient and intuitive solution to explore campus routes. While current campus-goers might already know their way around, this tool is perfect for newcomers. It makes navigating campus easy and intuitive. üå±

What's more, the technology behind this can be extended to rural areas, helping communities navigate unfamiliar terrain, making transportation and communication more efficient and accessible. üåç

## Overview

The system combines:
- Dijkstra's Algorithm for finding the shortest path.
- A graph representing campus locations and their connections.
- Folium for interactive map visualization.
- Streamlit for a simple, user-friendly web interface.

## Features

- **Shortest Path Calculation**: Find the shortest path between two locations on campus.
- **Interactive Map**: Visualize the shortest path on an interactive map with real-time markers and a highlighted route.
- **User Interface**: Easy-to-use Streamlit interface to select starting and destination points.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Display the shortest distance and the path dynamically based on user inputs.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)
