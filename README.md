# Campus-Dijkstra-Way

The **Campus-Dijkstra-Way** is a web application designed to help users find the shortest path between various locations within Jain University using **Dijkstra's Algorithm**. This tool allows students, faculty, and visitors to quickly navigate through the campus by selecting a starting point and a destination.

## Features

- **Shortest Path Calculation**: Find the shortest path between two locations on Jain University Campus using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
- **Interactive Map**: Visualize the path on an interactive map with real-time markers and a highlighted route.
- **Customizable Locations**: You can choose from a variety of campus locations.

## Tech Stack

- **Streamlit**: For creating the web application.
- **Python**: Backend programming.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Used for finding the shortest path.
- **Folium**: For rendering interactive maps.
- **Heapq**: For efficient priority queue implementation in Dijkstra's Algorithm.

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.x** installed on your machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install streamlit folium
